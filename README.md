## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection
This was the first onshape part that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the part mainly because of the helpful video. I learned what the difference between mirroring and creating a linear pattern. I struggled on the linear pattern part of the base because I was stuck on which direction to input to make the pattern face on the plane.
