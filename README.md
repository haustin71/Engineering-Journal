## Base

### Description

The 1st assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection
This was the first onshape part that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the part mainly because of the helpful video. I learned what the difference between mirroring and creating a linear pattern. I struggled on the linear pattern part of the base because I was stuck on which direction to input to make the pattern face on the plane.

## Mount

### Description

The 2nd assignment was to create a mount for the caster.  The mounts dimensions are 120 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 4 small holes that are 10 mm wide and and one large hole that is 25mm thick.

### Reflection
This was my second onshape part that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the part using the helpful video. I learned that you could create the same part using 3 different methods. I struggled with trying to dimension the circles for the 3rd way of creating the mount.

## Fork

### Description

The 3rd assignment was to create the fork for the tire of the caster.  The mountforks dimensions were dimensions are 80mm for the base and 8 mm thick for the extrude, and for the prongs it was 40mm by 5mm.

### Reflection
This was my third onshape part that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the part using the helpful video. I learned how to properly fillet and champher an extruded part.

## Tire

### Description

The 4th assignment was to create the tire so the caster can move and the wheel will not scratch up from the floor.  The tires dimensions are a trapezoid that was 20 mm with a slant of 10 degrees with an revolve of 360 degrees.

### Reflection
This was my 4th onshape part that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the tire fast and efficiently. I learned how to properly revolve a scetch in onshape

## Wheel

### Description

The 5th assignment was to create the wheel to create movement for the caster.  The wheels dimensions are an scetch that looks like the letter "I" with the top rectangle being 5mm by 20mm separated by a rectangle that is 5mm long and on the bottom is a rectangle that is 5mm thick and 20mm wide. the entire scetch has an diameter of 80 and the bottom rectangle haas a diameter of 25.

### Reflection
This was my fith onshape part that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the wheel but I got stuck on some parts mainly the first scetch. I learned how to cut holes using a circular pattern on an revolved part.

## Axle, Bearing and Collar

### Description

These were the 6th, 7th and 8th parts of the caster. the axles dimensions are 2 circles that have a diameter of 10 and 6 which are then extruded to make a cylinder. the axles dimensions are a 15mm circle with a 10mm extrude.

### Reflection
This was my final three onshape parts that I completed. I think that I did a good job with creating the axle and collar but I had a little trouble on the bearing.


## Group collaboration

### Description
Me and my groupmates were tasked with designing a piston with base and a clear glass cylinder. The parts That I created were the outer clear cylinder and the base.

### Evidence

### Reflection
This was the first time I did a collarboration prolect and I think it went really good. We all did our parts to complete the assignment. During the time we worked on the project I learned how to create a folder for multiple parts. I also learned how to create an identical part by mirroring the origional part.



## Hello Arduino

## Description
This was my first Arduino assignment we were tasked with making an LED blink.
## Code

[Hello Arduino Code](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/haustin71/bbee976d-e7ab-4bc3-be49-c34314b9ef06)

## Wiring for the Code


## Reflection
This was the first time that I have done code this year And I believe that I did well throughout the entire assignment. I learned how to connect different items on the breadboard and arduino uno to the code. I also learned what the terms Digital Read, Digital write, and Delay mean.
